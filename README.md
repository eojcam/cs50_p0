Four page site, Finger-Style Guitar Club, is designed
to encourage guitarists to begin playing with their hands,
without a guitar pick, or plectrum.

First page, index.html has forms to join the club, so as to
inform the author with regard to how many play with a pick,
or not, where they are from, their age, and name.

Second page, why.html states author's experience with
finger-style playing, and has a short table showing some
pluses and minuses for using the hands or a pick.

Third page, examples.html, has playable and downloadable audio
and music files in pdf format in a zip file for each of two
examples of finger-style guitar playing on electric and acoustic guitars, as played by the author. Both are original compositions.

Fourth page, connect.html, has image of author, a twitter link,
and a few links to other sources online on the subject, as well
as a link to author's teaching site.
