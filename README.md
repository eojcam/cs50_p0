Four page site, Finger-Style Guitar Club, is designed
to encourage guitarists to begin playing with their hands,
without a guitar pick, or plectrum.

First page, index.html has forms to join the club, so as to
inform the author with regard to how many play with a pick,
or not, where they are from, their age, and name.

Second page, why.html states author's experience with
finger-style playing, and has a short table showing some
pluses and minuses for using the hands or a pick.

Third page, examples.html, has playable and downloadable audio
and music files in pdf format in a zip file for each of two
examples of finger-style guitar playing on electric and acoustic guitars, as played by the author. Both are original compositions.

Fourth page, connect.html, has image of author, a twitter link,
and a few links to other sources online on the subject, as well
as a link to author's teaching site.

More detailed overview:

My site, Finger-Style Guitar Club, is a tongue in cheek look at the pros and cons of playing a guitar with just one’s hands, or with the aid of a guitar pick, or plectrum.

All pages link, and share a stylistic likeness in that they share the same nav and footer as well as other commonalities such as background color, text styles, and coloration.
There are two css files that I coded, a sass file,  a link for the favicon display, plus some bootstrap required files to make components work.

I began with the basic html5 structure, and first wrote code  common to all pages, then pasted so as to give all the same overall look.

First page, has forms, an image in the form of a favicon, and styling exhibiting the use of
a sass file,  variable,  nesting, and inheritance.

Utf code for an emoji is used in the header, as well as a bootstrap navbar that is collapsible and responsive in design.  A  media query in my styles_p0.css file changes the h1 tag when the screen size is reduced below 499px to fit more nicely in the available viewport.

A fixed bootstrap footer is located at the bottom, where a span is used to change the  font for the author’s name. Bootstrap code is used for copyright.

Page two, why.html has content referring to the author’s experience playing finger-style guitar and a table showing some pluses and minuses with regard to the use of a pick, or the hands alone.

Third page, examples.html has content referring to famous guitarists that are known to play finger-style, plus downloadable zip files containing pdf format charts and the audio files that are  playable (using the bootstrap audio component) from the page. Two column bootstrap grid layout is used to evenly space the electric and acoustic audio examples and links.  Utf code for music symbol is styled into links to zip files.

Last page, Connect.html,  provides an image of the author, a Twitter link, and a list of links to other sites with info on the subject of finger-style guitar playing.  Css styling  makes the text color of the links the same as the rest of the page, continuing the uniformity in page design.
